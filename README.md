## Installation

It is recommended to install scanner in a virtual environment. Here's how to create one using conda:
```bash
conda create -n scanner_env python=3.8
```
To install scanner, simply use pip:
```bash
pip install copy-scanner
```
## Requirements
Scanner requires [`bcftools`](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html), which must be included in `PATH`. All other dependencies should be installed automatically with pip.


## Quick Start
To get started with scanner, please refer to our [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md). Here's a quick example:
```python
import scanner
# define your json file path
path = "your/dir/to/json"
# preprocess
scanner.pp.preprocess(path)
# segment
scanner.tl.segment(path)
# infer copy number
scanner.tl.infer_copy_number(path)
# visualize 
scanner.pl.plot_whole_genome_track(path)
```

## Command line interface
For advanced users interested in multi-sample segmentation (e.g., repurposing for bulk samples), Scanner provides a command line interface. In bash, simply run:
```bash
scanner-segment -i {input_file} -l {LAMBDA} -o {output_file}
```
For more details, please refer to our [documentation](docs/).

## Operating System
